# CompareLibraries
Comparing Web3.js and Ethers.js and seeing which one is a better library



# Observations
One key thing I notice that is different between these two libraries is that a lot of the Web3 calls/methods are nested under `web3.utils` or `web3.eth` for example, whereas the calls/methods 
under ethers.js are usually not nested that deep although there are some calls that are, most of them are not. Some methods do have similar nesting but Ethers.js library is more readable, 
I would say. It makes more sense to me.
